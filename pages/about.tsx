                Driven by the mistmatch between our understanding of technologies and the rate at which they are adopted, my research vision is centered on understanding and guiding the design and usage of emerging technologies and platforms. More specifically, I am interested in the following areas:

              <ul className="list-decimal ml-10">
                <li>the impact of technological tools on individual work outcomes,</li>
                <li>the societal effects of emerging AI technologies, and</li>
                <li>the design considerations of digital platforms.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                I use a blend of methods, including field experiments, casual inference, machine learning, and analytical modeling.
